# Goal Management Tool for Employees and Managers

## Dependencies
To run, you will need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) installed, then you need to install all dependencies running the following command: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` in the backend directory and the frontend directory.

## Running the application
You will need two terminals, one will run the frontend and the other the backend. On the first terminal, cd to the backend directory `/backend`, and on the second cd to the frontend directory `/frontend`. On both terminals run 'npm run dev'. This will run both the frontend and backend. To access the web app now go to the link provided in the fronted console after running 'npm run dev' or just copy this link to your browser [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001)
